# Virtualized Table Component

This project is a high-performance, feature-rich virtualized table built with React. It efficiently handles large datasets with thousands of rows and dozens of columns, providing an excellent user experience even with heavy data loads.

## Key Features

- **Massive Data Support:** Smooth rendering of tables with 2000+ rows and 80 columns through row and column virtualization, drastically improving performance by only rendering visible content.

- **Row Virtualization:** Only visible rows are rendered to the DOM, ensuring fast scrolling and minimal resource consumption.

- **Internationalization (i18n):** Full multi-language support implemented for easy localization of all UI texts and messages.

- **Column Pinning:** Columns can be pinned to the left or right, enabling persistent visibility while scrolling horizontally through large datasets.

- **Sorting:** Users can sort row data in ascending or descending order on any column.

- **Resizable Columns:** Columns can be resized by dragging their edges, allowing flexible adjustment of column widths.

- **Column Reordering:** Drag-and-drop support to reorder columns dynamically.

- **Column Visibility Toggle:** Users can easily hide or unhide columns via an intuitive UI.

- **Smooth User Experience:** Responsive design with smooth scrolling and interactions, even with large datasets.
